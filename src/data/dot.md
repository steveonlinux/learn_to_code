# Methods or Dot Functions

A data type defines what operations can be used on that type and what *methods* or *dot functions* exist for objects of that type. These concepts will be covered more deeply near the end of the book, but for now know that this essentially means that the designers of Python designed functions for every data type to be manipulated. We will focus on the *string* and the *list* data types. We will use the built in functionality that Python offers to manipulate these data types.

## Dot Function Syntax

A *dot function* is a function that operates on an object of a specific type or *class*. They are also referred to as *methods*. The syntax of calling a dot function is appending a dot to the end of an
object followed by the fucntion name and a parenthetical:

```Python
object.functionName()
```
The function takes the object as an input, and outputs something based on the input and the function's definition. Remember that the function must be for the data type of the object. Again, we will be using methods that are built into Python by its developers for use on its data types.

## Strings

### Concatenation
The `+` operator not only works for numbers but also strings. When two strings are "added", the string on the right will be appended to the one on the left. This is known as *concatenation*.

For example:
