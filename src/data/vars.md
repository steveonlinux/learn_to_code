# Variables

There are two ways to represent data values in python:
* Literal Values
* Variables

## Literal Values
Literal Values are the values themselves. If, for example, I type `7` into my python interpreter I am using the literal value 7. If I enter `7+7`. I am adding two literal values and will be returned 14.

## Variables
Most programming languages allow programmers to assign variables to values. Variables are just names. We give the data names so that we can refer to the variables rather than the literal values. This makes the data easier to follow and change. Python has some restirctions on what variable names can be:

* A variable may only contain
	* Lowercase letters
	* Uppercase letters
	* Digits
	* Underscore
* Variables are *case-sensitive*.
* A variable may not begin with a digit
* A variable may not be a *reserved word*.
Reserved words may be found using the command:
```Python
help("keywords")
```
