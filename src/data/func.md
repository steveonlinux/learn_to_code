# Functions

In programming, a function is code that accepts an input and returns an output. What the fucntion accepts is called a *parameter*. A function can have as many parameters as needed. Generally, a function takes parameters, does somethings with them, and returns something based on what the parameters were. Running a fucntion is referred to as *calling* a function or a function *call*. Based on the function's *definition*, it will only accepts paramaters of specific data types, in a specified order. Furthermore, a function will only return data of the type it is defined to.

## Syntax
In Python, and many other programming languages, calling a function has the following syntax: `functionName()`.
The name of the function followed by a parenthetical. Within the parenthese goes the parameters. The paramters are ordered and seperated by commas. Let's look at some commonly used functions that are already built into Python.

## print()
In the famous "Hello World!" program, we use the `print()` function. 

```Python
print("Hello World!")
```
Here, the `print()` function accepts a single parameter, a string to be printed.

## input()
Another commonly used function is `input()`. This function also takes a single parameter: the string to be displayed to the user prompting the user to input data.
