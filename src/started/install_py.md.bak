There are two options when installing.

### Admin Privlidges
This option should be enabled assuming you are using your personal computer. Admin privledges in Windows gnerally allow you to install programs and alter specific files. Installing the Python interpreter with admin privledges will allow your scripts you write and run to have greater access to your computer, however this msut be done responsibly; or esle you may damage your operating system.

### Path Variable 
This option should be enabled. A path variable is a variable that contains every directory that ayour user can execute files from no matter what directory the suer is currently in. Essentially, when this option is checked, the directory python is installed to will be addedf to your path variable, so you can execute the interpreter from anywhere.

There are some things installed alongside the interpreter bty default liek *pip*. Pip is a Python *package manager*. It will be discussed at the end of the book in the "And More..." section.

Once the interpreter is installed you will be greeted with a success screen.
