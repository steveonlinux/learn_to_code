# Programming Languages

## Declarative vs Imperative

Programming is essentially the act of writing something that a computer understands and will have a computer do something based on what is written. The rules
by which to write something that a computer understands is called a programming *language*. There are two overarching types of languages. Also known as paradigms.

- Decalrative Languages
- Imperative Languages

A declarative language describes how something is, or more technically it defines a state that the computer must reach. A declarative statement in human language
could be "The ball is red". Some examples of imperative languages are:

- YAML
- HTML
- SQL

An imperative language offers the instructions or commands to a computer it needs to perform to acchomplish a task. An imperative statement in human language could be,
"Paint the ball red." Some examples of declarative languages are:

- C
- Java
- Rust

And many programming languages have the capability to be both declarative and imperative. There are many programming languages that have been desgined and created in history by people, groups, organizations, and corporations
all over the world. However, the book will use imperative programming with the programming language **Python** to teach the basic concepts of programming. By understanding absic programming concepts, the languages you choose
to write in become secondary.

## Why Python?

Python is a programming language that is commonly used to teach new programmers the basics. This is becuase Python's design makes it a simpler language to read and write.

### Syntax

*Syntax* is the rules by which something is written. For example, in English adjectives come before nouns; and verbs tend to come before subjects. This is an example of English's syntax.
The same is true for computer languages; the rules of writing the same thing differs between languages. However, once you understand the basic concepts of programming, beginning to learn a
new language is only a matter of getting familiar with its syntax.
