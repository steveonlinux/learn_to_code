# Introduction

## About Me
My name is Steve. I am a computer science major who is very passionate about programming and computer science in general and I hope to one day obtain a master's degree in either computer science or math. I also love film, fashion, and hiking/camping.

## Who This Book Is For
The book is for any one who isn't familiar with coding but with like to begin learning. This book is written specifically with a teenage audience in mind, however any new programmer will benefit form the contents of this book. The book is meant to instill the core concepts of programming using Python, however these concepts can be applied to many other languages and computer systems. Many Python specific things will be glossed over in this book to make it as generally applicable as possible, however, the Python documentation is often linked for further reading.

## Book Structure
Every chapter corresponds to a core concept of programming. The order of these topics is mostly ordered in a way that allows for concepts to be built upon one another foundationally. Each section contains examples, diagrams, and most end in a *Further Reading* section that links to other documents that extend a topic beyond the scope of the book. The second section of the book contains outlines of popular and noteworthy projects that may be worked on to reinforce coding practices and uses. The glossary at the end contains many example programs organized by concepts illustrated. The glossary also contains tables of vocabulary words, definitions, and hotkeys. The first use of a vocabulary words are *italized* throughout the book and can be found in this section.
