<p>My name is Steve. I am a computer science major who is very passionate about programming and computer science in general and I hope to one day obtain a master's degree in either computer science or math. I also love film, fashion, and hiking/camping.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-book-is-for"><a class="header" href="#who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book Is For</a></h2>
<p>The book is for any one who isn't familiar with coding but with like to begin learning. This book is written specifically with a teenage audience in mind, however any new programmer will benefit form the contents of this book. The book is meant to instill the core concepts of programming using Python, however these concepts can be applied to many other languages and computer systems. Many Python specific things will be glossed over in this book to make it as generally applicable as possible, however, the Python documentation is often linked for further reading.</p>
<h2 id="book-structure"><a class="header" href="#book-structure">Book Structure</a></h2>
<p>Every chapter corresponds to a core concept of programming. The order of these topics is mostly ordered in a way that allows for concepts to be built upon one another foundationally. Each section contains examples, diagrams, and most end in a <em>Further Reading</em> section that links to other documents that extend a topic beyond the scope of the book. The second section of the book contains outlines of popular and noteworthy projects that may be worked on to reinforce coding practices and uses. The glossary at the end contains many example programs organized by concepts illustrated. The glossary also contains tables of vocabulary words, definitions, and hotkeys. The first use of a vocabulary words are <em>italicized</em> throughout the book and can be found in the glossary.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-programming"><a class="header" href="#what-is-programming">What Is Programming?</a></h1>
<p>Programming is essentially providing instructions to a system to accomplish a task or receive a result. Everything you see see when you use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or phone are all the result of programming. Every aspect of the operation of your electronic devices, even your home appliances like your toaster and fridge, can contain code being executed. Code controls the electricity coursing through the circuitry of a device to to the pixels of a screen that change colors every fraction of a second. Every button click and key press in your favorite app or preferred operating system executes code that someone wrote to interact with other systems someone else wrote to do what that button click does. </p>
<p>Programming involves taking very small and precise steps. But all those steps culminate in every website, video game, operating system, or video you've ever seen on a computer screen. Everyone of those steps add up to programs that are millions of lines long that hundreds of people have worked on and contributed to for decades. However, many programs that have been used for decades are relatively small. Often one person has an idea that they believe will make their or others' lives easier and executes it by writing a program that does that thing. To learn to program it takes understanding that an idea can be realized and the drive to make that idea a reality through learning.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="programming-languages"><a class="header" href="#programming-languages">Programming Languages</a></h1>
<h2 id="declarative-vs-imperative"><a class="header" href="#declarative-vs-imperative">Declarative vs Imperative</a></h2>
<p>Programming is essentially the act of writing something that a computer understands and will have a computer do something based on what is written. The rules
by which to write something that a computer understands is called a programming <em>language</em>. There are two overarching types of languages. Also known as paradigms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Declarative Languages</li>
<li>Imperative Languages</li>
</ul>
<p>A declarative language describes how something is, or more technically it defines a state that the computer must reach. A declarative statement in human language
could be &quot;The ball is red&quot;. Some examples of imperative languages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>YAML</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>SQL</li>
</ul>
<p>An imperative language offers the instructions or commands to a computer it needs to perform to accomplish a task. An imperative statement in human language could be,
&quot;Paint the ball red.&quot; Some examples of declarative languages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Rust</li>
</ul>
<p>And many programming languages have the capability to be both declarative and imperative. There are many programming languages that have been designed and created in history by individuals, groups, organizations, and corporations
all over the world. However, the book will use imperative programming with the programming language <strong>Python</strong> to teach the basic concepts of programming. By understanding basic programming concepts, the languages you choose to write in will become secondary.</p>
<h2 id="compiled-vs-interpreted"><a class="header" href="#compiled-vs-interpreted">Compiled vs Interpreted</a></h2>
<p>The only thing a computer truly understands is 0s and 1s. <em>Binary code</em>. Also known as <em>machine code</em> or <em>machine instructions</em>. All the code written has to be somehow converted to 0s and 1s. So, 
along with the languages, programmers also design and create programs used to convert the code to binary. There are two primary ways of converting code to what a computer understands.</p>
<h3 id="compilers"><a class="header" href="#compilers">Compilers</a></h3>
<p>Compiled languages are languages where the source code of the language is passed to a <em>compiler</em>, which converts the source code to an <em>executable</em> or <em>binary</em> file. Programs are compiled to be run on
a specific machine or hardware. Therefore, to be run on another machine, it must be compiled for that machine, and every other machine it is to be ran on. </p>
<p><img src="started/./imgs/compilers.drawio.png" alt="compilers" />
<em>The path of code from source to executable</em>.</p>
<p>Compiled languages are often used to control hardware itself. Compiled languages are often used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Embedded Software</li>
<li>Device Drivers</li>
<li>Automotives</li>
<li>Aeronautics and Aerospace</li>
<li>Video Game Engines</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of compiled languages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Rust </li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Go</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpreters"><a class="header" href="#interpreters">Interpreters</a></h3>
<p>Interpreted languages are languages where the source code of the languages is passed to an <em>interpreter</em>. The interpreter does not convert the source code to a binary file, but instead runs the source code itself line by line. Therefore, the source code of an interpreted language can be ran on any machine which runs the interpreter. The source code of interpreted languages is often referred to as <em>scripts</em>, and the languages <em>scripting</em> languages. This makes interpreted programs easier to run in more places, this is called <em>portability</em>. And interpreted languages are generally more portable than compiled ones. </p>
<p><img src="started/./imgs/interpreters.drawio.png" alt="interpreters" /></p>
<p><em>Source code being given to the interpreter to be ran</em>.</p>
<p>Interpreted languages are often used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Science and Statistics</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Computing System Administration</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of interpreted languages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>JavaScript </li>
<li>Shell </li>
<li>Powershell</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Lua</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-python"><a class="header" href="#why-python">Why Python?</a></h2>
<p>Python is an interpreted programming language that is commonly used to teach new programmers the basics. This is because Python's design makes it a simpler language to read and write.</p>
<h3 id="syntax"><a class="header" href="#syntax">Syntax</a></h3>
<p><em>Syntax</em> is the rules by which something is written. For example, in English adjectives come before nouns; and verbs tend to come before subjects. This is an example of English's syntax. However,
in Spanish adjectives tend to come after verbs. This is an example of Spanish's syntax and how human languages can differ in syntax.
The same is true for computer languages; the rules of writing something with the same meaning differs between languages. However, once you understand the basic concepts of programming, beginning to learn a new language is only a matter of getting familiar with its syntax.</p>
<h3 id="portability"><a class="header" href="#portability">Portability</a></h3>
<p>Python is <em>portable</em>, as in, the interpreter can be ran in many places, such as a desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet.</p>
<h3 id="popularity"><a class="header" href="#popularity">Popularity</a></h3>
<p>Python is an <strong>extremely</strong> popular language that is used across the world by both individuals and large companies and organizations.</p>
<hr />
<p>This was just an <strong>introduction</strong> to the different programming paradigms and types of programming languages. There are many more categories languages can be divided and subdivided into. These categories aren't discussed here because they require a more advanced understanding of how programming languages work and are designed.</p>
<p>Python's design is what makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced programmers; and its design is why it is the most popular programming language in the world as of this writing. Next you will learn what programs can be used to actually write code in any given programming language, including Python.</p>

<p>Ultimately, all the code we write is just text. Instructions that we type and give to a computer to perform. However,
there are different kinds of programs we can use to write code more easily, and efficiently.</p>

<p>There are features common to these types of programs that make writing code easier and more efficient. For example:</p>
<h3 id="syntax-highlighting"><a class="header" href="#syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</a></h3>
<p>Syntax highlighting is a feature that colorizes different parts of the code to make it more easily readable by a human.
The code snippets in this book are syntax highlighted.</p>
<h3 id="code-completion"><a class="header" href="#code-completion">Code Completion</a></h3>
<p>Code completion is a feature that allows the program being used to write code to auto-complete code being written, or offer suggestions
based on the code that you've already written. This is useful for saving time when writing.</p>
<h3 id="built-in-interpreters"><a class="header" href="#built-in-interpreters">Built In Interpreters</a></h3>
<p>Some programs used for writing code allow us to run and test our code in the same program used to write the code. This is useful so 
we don't have to go to another program every time we want to test or run something.</p>
<h3 id="plugins"><a class="header" href="#plugins">Plugins</a></h3>
<p>These programs usually support the use of <em>plugins</em>, which are essentially add-ons that add even more functionality.</p>
<h2 id="text-editors"><a class="header" href="#text-editors">Text Editors</a></h2>
<p>The most basic kind of program we can use to write code are <em>text editors</em>. There are programs that simply allow us to
write and save text files and not much more. A common text editor installed by default in Microsoft Windows is <strong>Notepad</strong>.
A more feature and rich text editor, one designed specifically to write code is *Notepad++&quot;. Notepad++ offers syntax highlighting and
allows the use of plugins to extend its capabilities. Here is a list of commonly used text editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notepad</li>
<li>Vim</li>
<li>Notepad++</li>
<li>Geany </li>
<li>Notepadqq</li>
<li>Sublime</li>
<li>Emacs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integrated-development-environments-or-ides"><a class="header" href="#integrated-development-environments-or-ides">Integrated Development Environments or IDEs</a></h2>
<p>The next step above a text editors are <em>integrated development environments</em> or <em>IDEs</em>. IDEs offer everything text editors do and more.
IDEs usually offer features that would be found in an entirely other program, and give the programmer the ability to stay in the editor instead
of having to switch programs frequently. Some of these features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code interpretation or compilation</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
</ul>
<p>IDEs usually are designed for use with a a specific programming language, however IDEs exist that are used for programming in general. Also ,since IDEs are so much more feature rich that text editors, they usually are more complicated and tend to have a steeper learning curve.
Some examples of popular IDEs used today are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>PyCharm</li>
<li>Eclipse</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personalized-development-environments-or-pdes"><a class="header" href="#personalized-development-environments-or-pdes">Personalized Development Environments or PDEs</a></h2>
<p>There is a lesser known concept of a <em>personalized development environment</em> or <em>pde</em>. This is essentially a text editor that has been customized extensively by installing plugins and other software. So, it
is a text editor that has been personalized by the user for their own, specific use. Two editors that are commonly personalized by users are VIM and Emacs.</p>
<hr />
<p>These types of programs are plentiful and it is common practice to try as many as one likes to find one that suits their preferences and the language they are writing in.</p>

<h2 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h2>
<p>The Python interpreter can be downloaded for Windows from the Python's official website.</p>
<p><img src="started/./imgs/python_downloads.png" alt="python Site" />
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></p>
<p>Once the installer is downloaded,  go to the directory it was downloaded to and execute it. </p>
<p><img src="started/./imgs/python_file.png" alt="python file" /><br />
<em>The Python installer I downloaded to my computer.</em></p>
<p>Once the installer is launched you will be greeted by this screen:
<img src="started/./imgs/python_installer.png" alt="python installer" /></p>
<p>There are two options when installing.</p>
<h3 id="admin-privileges"><a class="header" href="#admin-privileges">Admin Privileges</a></h3>
<p>This option should be enabled assuming you are using your personal computer. Admin privileges in Windows generally allow you to install programs and alter specific files. Installing the Python interpreter with admin privileges will allow your scripts you write and run to have greater access to your computer, however this must be done responsibly; or else you may damage your operating system.</p>
<h3 id="path-variable"><a class="header" href="#path-variable">Path Variable</a></h3>
<p>This option should be enabled. A path variable is a variable that contains every directory that your user can execute files from no matter what directory the user is currently in. Essentially, when this option is checked, the directory python is installed to will be added to your path variable, so you can execute the interpreter from anywhere.</p>
<p>There are some things installed alongside the interpreter by default like <em>pip</em>. Pip is a Python <em>package manager</em>. It will be discussed at the end of the book in the &quot;And More...&quot; section.</p>
<p>Once the interpreter is installed you will be greeted with a success screen.</p>
<p><img src="started/./imgs/python_success.png" alt="python success" /></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="executing-python-code"><a class="header" href="#executing-python-code">Executing Python Code</a></h1>
<p>There are two ways Python code can be ran or <em>executed</em>. </p>
<h2 id="script-mode"><a class="header" href="#script-mode">Script Mode</a></h2>
<p><em>Script mode</em> is where any entire program or <em>script</em> is written from beginning to end and then saved as a file. That file is then passed to the interpreter for the interpreter to execute the script, line by line, from beginning to end. </p>
<h3 id="write-and-save-a-py-file"><a class="header" href="#write-and-save-a-py-file">Write And Save A .py File</a></h3>
<p>For the Python interpreter, the file should be save as a <code>.py</code> file. For example say I wrote a Python script named myscript, I would save this file as <code>myscript.py</code>. </p>
<h3 id="executing-a-python-script"><a class="header" href="#executing-a-python-script">Executing A Python Script</a></h3>
<p>Depending on your preference you can either run your script in an IDE or the terminal.</p>
<p>If using the terminal, the command <code>python</code> calls the interpreter. Now this command takes an <em>argument</em> that is the name of the script file. So, if I wanted to run <code>myscript.py</code> I would make sure I am in the directory that contains the file and type into the terminal <code>python myscript.py</code> and press <code>enter</code>. This calls the interpreter, and gives it my script to run.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-mode"><a class="header" href="#interactive-mode">Interactive Mode</a></h2>
<p><em>Interactive Mode</em> is where the interpreter provides a <em>shell</em> or an environment that allows us to execute code as it is given to the interpreter. This mode is generally used for things like quick math or small tests. </p>
<p>Your IDE may provide a window where a shell is visible. Otherwise, to reach the interactive mode you simply type <code>python</code> into a terminal without any arguments and hit <code>Enter</code>. Whether your IDE provides a shell or you reach a shell in your terminal you will see a <em>prompt</em>. A prompt denotes a new line where commands or code will be entered. You should see <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> as your prompt when in interactive mode. From here you can type any Python code you like, and every time you hit <code>Enter</code>, that line, and that line alone, will be interpreted. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-data"><a class="header" href="#what-is-data">What Is Data?</a></h1>
<p>Data is simply information. A computer stores data or information in Random Access Memory (RAM), in secondary storage like a hard drive or solid state drive, or in the Central Processing Unit (CPU). When programming, we are primarily using data that is being stored in memory. All the data in your computer's memory are bits: zeroes and ones. This is all a computer truly knows. The same pattern of bits can be defined to represent different things. Programming languages keep track of where the data is and what is represents. What kind of thing the data represents is known as a <em>type</em>. </p>

<h1 id="visualizing-objects"><a class="header" href="#visualizing-objects">Visualizing Objects</a></h1>
<p>Python groups bit patterns into <em>objects</em>. Objects are like boxes, that keep track of: </p>
<ul>
<li>What type of data is inside of it</li>
<li>The literal value of the data</li>
<li>Its location in memory</li>
<li>How often the object is used</li>
</ul>
<p><em>An object's type determines what its possible values are and what operations can be performed on it</em>.</p>
<p>Python is known as an <em>object oriented</em> language. Keep in mind that not all programming languages utilize objects. In some languages, the programmer must keep track of the location of data, and what type that data is themselves. Due to the object paradigm, Python is a <em>strongly typed language</em>. In strongly typed languages, the data type of an object doesn't change implicitly. Essentially, data objects are like a box that exists somewhere in the computer's memory. This box contains the data itself, and everything the computer needs to know what that data means and to use that data. In the next section, we'll cover variables, which are used to give names to different objects.</p>
<hr />
<p>Knowing the different data types a programming language offers allows you to know what ways the language allows you to represent and store information. Since many of the data types Python offers are unique to Python, such as Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples, we will focus on types that can be found in programming languages more generally. Throughout the book we will focus on the numerical data types, strings, lists, and booleans extensively. In the next sections, we will learn how to name objects of any type using <em>variables</em>.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading-3"><a class="header" href="#further-reading-3">Further Reading</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">Data Types</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html">Python Built-in Types</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h1>
<p>There are two ways to represent data values in python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literal Values</li>
<li>Variables</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="literal-values"><a class="header" href="#literal-values">Literal Values</a></h2>
<p>Literal Values are the values themselves. If, for example, I type <code>7</code> into my python interpreter I am using the literal value 7. If I enter <code>7+7</code>. I am adding two literal values and will be returned 14.</p>
<h2 id="variables-1"><a class="header" href="#variables-1">Variables</a></h2>
<p>Most programming languages allow programmers to assign variables to values. Variables are just names. We give the data names so that we can refer to the variables rather than the literal values. This makes the data easier to follow and change. Python has some restrictions on what variable names can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A variable may only contain
<ul>
<li>Lowercase letters</li>
<li>Uppercase letters</li>
<li>Digits</li>
<li>Underscore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Variables are <em>case-sensitive</em>.</li>
<li>A variable may not begin with a digit</li>
<li>A variable may not be a <em>reserved word</em>.
Reserved words may be found using the command:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-Python">help(&quot;keywords&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="assignment"><a class="header" href="#assignment">Assignment</a></h2>
<p>Variables can be <em>assigned</em> values using the <em>assignment</em> operator: <code>=</code>, with the variable name on the left and the value on the right. Operations will be covered in the next section. But for now know that in most programming languages <code>=</code> does not mean &quot;equal to&quot; or &quot;is&quot;. It is an action that can be thought as &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make equal to&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">a = 7
</code></pre>
<p>could be said in words as &quot;make a 7&quot;, &quot;make a equal to 7&quot;, or &quot;let a be 7&quot;.</p>
<p>And now if a is put into the interpreter it will return 7 because a is now 7 and will be treated as such. </p>
<h1 id="variables-and-objects"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-objects">Variables and Objects</a></h1>
<p>Recall that in Python all data is organized into objects to help keep track of the data and what the data represents. When we apply our knowledge of Python objects, to what we know about variables and assignment, we can detail what's actually happening. In our previous example we assigned the variable name a to the integer object 7.  Let's extend our previous example and assign something to a.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">a = 7
b = a
</code></pre>
<p>If you recall the transitive property from mathematics you know that if a is 7, and b is a then b is also 7. Now what if we change a from 7 to something else or in other words <em>reassign</em> a? </p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">a = 7
b = a
a = 11
</code></pre>
<p>What do you think is now the case? Since a is changed is b now changed as well? The answer reveals something important about variables and objects in Python.</p>
<h2 id="references"><a class="header" href="#references">References</a></h2>
<p>In some programming languages the variable name is a <em>location</em>, in other words, in those languages a variables name is the name of a place that contains the data. Python IS NOT one of these languages. In Python variables are <em>references</em>. They refer to or <em>point</em> to a data object. These types of variables are sometimes called <em>pointers</em>. </p>
<p><img src="data/./imgs/var1.drawio.png" alt="var1" /></p>
<p><em>Diagram of our variable names pointing to different objects</em></p>
<p>In short, in Python variables are only names. When you assign a variable, you are simply naming some data object. </p>
<p>Let's return to our previous example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">a = 7
b = a
a = 11
</code></pre>
<p>In this Python code snippet, the following occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li>a is pointed to an integer object with a value of 7.</li>
<li>b is pointed to the value that a point to (7).</li>
<li>a is pointed to a new integer object with a value if 11.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="data/./imgs/var2.drawio.png" alt="var2" /></p>
<p>So, if you enter <code>b</code> into the interpreter, it will return <code>7</code>. This is because when you assign b to a, you are simply giving the object <code>7</code> two different names: a and b. In other words, you are point b to the same data object a is pointing to. Then, when <code>a</code> is assigned to <code>11</code>, it is being pointed to a new data object, but that does not change what b is pointing to, so <code>b</code> remains 7.</p>
<h1 id="variable-naming-conventions"><a class="header" href="#variable-naming-conventions">Variable Naming Conventions</a></h1>
<p>Outside of the Python keywords and rules we can name variables whatever we please. But what is a good variable name. In larger programs, good names are important to keep the code readable. So you, or another person unfamiliar to the code can easily read, understand, and follow it. </p>
<p>Your variable names should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brief</li>
<li>Descriptive</li>
<li>Unique</li>
</ul>
<p>A common variable naming convention used is called <em>camelCase</em>. camelCase separates multiple words in a name by capitalizing the last word of the variable name. Another common convention is <em>snake_case</em>. Where the words in the name are separated by underscores. snake_case is commonly used in Python and is what will be used in this book.</p>
<hr />
<p>This section introduced variables, which in Python, are names or references to objects. In the next sections operations that can be used on variables, and thus objects, will be introduced.</p>

<h2 id="arithmetic-operations-1"><a class="header" href="#arithmetic-operations-1">Arithmetic Operations</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of operations in mathematics we can use to calculate values using numbers. These are <em>arithmetic</em> operations. The arithmetic operations available to use in Python are listed below:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th><th>Result Returned</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>+</td><td>Addition</td><td>7+7</td><td>14</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>Subtraction</td><td>70-1</td><td>69</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>Multiplication</td><td>7*7</td><td>49</td></tr>
<tr><td>/</td><td>Floating-point division</td><td>7 / 2</td><td>3.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>//</td><td>Integer or Truncated Division</td><td>7 // 2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>%</td><td>Modulus or Remainder of Integer Division</td><td>7 % 3</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>**</td><td>Exponentiation</td><td>7 ** 2</td><td>49</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>These examples are performing the operations on <em>literal values</em> as in the objects themselves not variables. Operations can be performed on both literal values and variables. Her are more examples:</p>
<h3 id="addition-and-subtraction"><a class="header" href="#addition-and-subtraction">Addition and Subtraction</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + 4
10
</code></pre>
<p>Addition and subtraction works as expected. Note the use of both literal values and variables.
And we can include as many <em>operands</em> as possible. An operand is any object being operated on by an operation. </p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 7+10-2+11-14+a
18
</code></pre>
<h3 id="multiplication"><a class="header" href="#multiplication">Multiplication</a></h3>
<p>Multiplication is similar. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 10*7*15*5
5250
</code></pre>
<h3 id="division"><a class="header" href="#division">Division</a></h3>
<p>Division is a different story since there are different styles. There is floating point division: <code>/</code>. And division with <em>truncation</em>: <code>//</code>. Truncation is just removing everything after the decimal point. Truncating is essentially just rounding down to the nearest integer in the case of positive numbers and rounding up in the case of negatives.</p>
<h4 id="floating-point-division"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-division">Floating Point Division</a></h4>
<p>Floating point division is division that will return the answer of division including if it is a floating point (a decimal number). For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 7.5 / 2
3.75
</code></pre>
<h4 id="division-with-truncation"><a class="header" href="#division-with-truncation">Division With Truncation</a></h4>
<p>Truncation will remove everything after the decimal point. It is essentially rounding or removing any remainder. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 7.5 // 2
3.0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="modulus"><a class="header" href="#modulus">Modulus</a></h3>
<p>Modulus or mod for short simply returns the remainder of division. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 7.5 % 2
1.5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="exponentiation"><a class="header" href="#exponentiation">Exponentiation</a></h3>
<p>Exponentiation is raising a number by an exponent. The number being raised, or the base, goes on the left. And the exponent is on the right. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 ** 2
9
</code></pre>
<h2 id="assignment-operators"><a class="header" href="#assignment-operators">Assignment Operators</a></h2>
<p>Assignment operators are operators that allow us to both conduct an arithmetic operation on a variable and assign the result to the variable with a single operation. In other words, the arithmetic operation and assignment operation are combined into one step.</p>
<p>The assignment operators found in Python are listed below </p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>=</td><td>Assigns value to variable</td></tr>
<tr><td>+=</td><td>Adds value and assigns result</td></tr>
<tr><td>-=</td><td>Subtracts by value and assigns result</td></tr>
<tr><td>*=</td><td>Multiplies by value and assigns result</td></tr>
<tr><td>/=</td><td>Divides by value and assigns result</td></tr>
<tr><td>**=</td><td>Raises by power and assigns result</td></tr>
<tr><td>%=</td><td>Computes modulus between value and assigns result</td></tr>
<tr><td>//</td><td>Floor divides by value and assigns result</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Not every operator will be given an example for the sake of brevity, but the concept is the same for all. Let's use multiplication for our example. Consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; myNumber = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; myNumber = myNumber * 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; myNumber
49
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>myNumber</code> is assigned to 7. Then it is assigned to itself times 7 which is 49. And when returned it is now assigned to 49. Where it is being assigned to itself times 7 can be combined into a single operation with an assignment operator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; myNumber = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; myNumber *= 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; myNumber
49
</code></pre>
<p>The result of this code block is the same, however the multiplication and reassignment of <code>myNumber</code> is combined into the <code>*=</code> operator.</p>

<p>This section described Python's arithmetic operations. To see more examples of these operations in use check the appendix. The next section will cover logical operations.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-logic"><a class="header" href="#what-is-logic">What is Logic?</a></h2>
<p>Logic is a kind of math that is likely different than what you are familiar with. Logic is used to determine whether something is true or false. And operations in logic
don't use numbers, but only truth values. As in, true or false. Recall, that computers can only truly understand 0s and 1s. Naturally, logic is applicable to the design and study of computers. Since there are only two possible values,
0 can be thought of as false, and 1 as true. And using logic, outcomes can be mathematically calculated within the circuitry of a computer the same way we determine whether something is true. In our case, we will use logic to calculate whether somethings is true, or if certain conditions are met, in our code. </p>
<h2 id="truth-tables"><a class="header" href="#truth-tables">Truth Tables</a></h2>
<p>Before we discuss the operations themselves, we must first discuss <em>truth tables</em>. Truth tables are used to describe the output of an operation given
the truthfulness of the inputs. Truth tables are a good way of visualizing the way the operations work and what to expect when they are used. A truth table is a table with a 
column for each input and a column for the output. The table demonstrates every possible combination of inputs and the output each combination gives.</p>
<h2 id="booleans"><a class="header" href="#booleans">Booleans</a></h2>
<p>Recall that booleans are a data type that only have two possible values, <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Logical operations can only be performed using Boolean values.
It is common for truthness to be represented as 1 and falseness with 0. And in Python, either the word or numerical representation may be used; the following examples will demonstrate this.</p>
<h2 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h2>
<p>There are three logical operations we will use are AND, OR and NOT. Each operation will be discussed and a truth table for each will be provided. Keep in mind

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="methods-or-dot-functions"><a class="header" href="#methods-or-dot-functions">Methods or Dot Functions</a></h1>
<p>A data type defines what operations can be used on that type and what <em>methods</em> or <em>dot functions</em> exist for objects of that type. These concepts will be covered more deeply near the end of the book, but for now know that this essentially means that the designers of Python designed functions for every data type to be manipulated. We will focus on the <em>string</em> and the <em>list</em> data types. We will use the built in functionality that Python offers to manipulate these data types.</p>
<h2 id="dot-function-syntax"><a class="header" href="#dot-function-syntax">Dot Function Syntax</a></h2>
<p>A <em>dot function</em> is a function that operates on an object of a specific type or <em>class</em>. They are also referred to as <em>methods</em>. The syntax of calling a dot function is appending a dot to the end of an
object followed by the function name and a parenthetical:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">object.functionName()
</code></pre>
<p>The function takes the object as an input, and outputs something based on the input and the function's definition. Remember that the function must be for the data type of the object. Again, we will be using methods that are built into Python by its developers for use on its data types.</p>
<h2 id="strings"><a class="header" href="#strings">Strings</a></h2>
<h3 id="concatenation"><a class="header" href="#concatenation">Concatenation</a></h3>
<p>The <code>+</code> operator not only works for numbers but also strings. When two strings are &quot;added&quot;, the string on the right will be appended to the one on the left. This is known as <em>concatenation</em>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = &quot;hello&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = &quot; world! &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x+y
'hello world! '
</code></pre>
<p>Here the string <code>y</code> is appended to the string <code>x</code>.</p>
<h3 id="capitalization"><a class="header" href="#capitalization">Capitalization</a></h3>
<p>Now say I need to capitalize every word of this sentence. We can use the <code>.title()</code> function to accomplish this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = &quot;hello&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = &quot; world! &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x+y).title()
'Hello World! '
</code></pre>
<h3 id="strip-whitespace"><a class="header" href="#strip-whitespace">Strip Whitespace</a></h3>
<p>Now say I want to remove the <em>whitespace</em> I left at the end of the string. Whitespace is any space that isn't text such as a <code>Space</code> or <code>Tab</code>. The <code>.strip()</code> function does this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = &quot;hello&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = &quot; world! &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x+y).title().strip()
'Hello World!'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that dot functions can be listed one after the other. They work in order from outside in. In other words, from right to left.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = &quot;hello&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = &quot; world! &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = x + y
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = z.strip()
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = z.title()
&gt;&gt;&gt; z
'Hello World!'
</code></pre>
<p>Here the same is accomplished by assigning <code>x+y</code> to <code>z</code> and using the functions on z one at a time. The main difference between these two ways is that some would say one is more readable by a human than the other. Depending on the context this may be true.</p>
<h2 id="lists"><a class="header" href="#lists">Lists</a></h2>
<p>Python contains numerous built in methods for manipulating lists.
Say I have a list of numbers 1 - 10:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="append"><a class="header" href="#append">Append</a></h3>
<p>The <code>.append()</code> method will add a new object to the end of a list. I will continue the pattern and add <code>11</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList.append(11)
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="pop"><a class="header" href="#pop">Pop</a></h3>
<p>The <code>.pop</code> method will remove or &quot;pop&quot; the first last object out of the list. </p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; myList.pop()
11
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="reverse"><a class="header" href="#reverse">Reverse</a></h3>
<p>The <code>.reverse()</code> method reverses the order of all elements in a list. </p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; myList.reverse()
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList
[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>This section is just a small taste of the different built-in methods Python has to offer. Every data type has a number of methods available for use. The list of methods used and discussed in this book is by no means exhaustive. Refer to the Python documentation for more information. Links to some of the documentation are below. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="type-conversion"><a class="header" href="#type-conversion">Type Conversion</a></h1>
<p>Python gives us the ability to convert some data from one type to another, depending on the types. This is known as <em>type casting</em>. </p>
<p>This is can especially useful when getting user input. Recall, <code>input()</code> which allows us to obtain input from a user. Say we want to get two numbers from the user to be multiplied together.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = input(&quot;Enter First Number:&quot;)
y = input (&quot;Enter Second Number:&quot;)
z = x * y
print(z)
</code></pre>
<p>If you run this code and provide numbers you will recieve an error. This is becuase the numbers provided are <em>strings</em>. <code>input()</code> returns strings and strings can't be multiplied. What <code>input()</code> returns must be <em>casted</em> to an integer. The function <code>int()</code> does this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = input(&quot;Enter First Number:&quot;)
y = input (&quot;Enter Second Number:&quot;)
z = int(x) * int(y)
print(z)
</code></pre>
<p>The code now works! <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are each casted to ints before they are multiplied so there is now no error.</p>
<h2 id="nesting"><a class="header" href="#nesting">Nesting</a></h2>
<p>This code can be made a little cleaner if we know that functions can be nested. Nested means &quot;inside one another. Essentially functions, and other structures in most programming languages can be nested. When functions are nested, they run from the inside out. In other words, when nested the innermost function will execute first, then the one directly above it, and so forth. </p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = int(input(&quot;Enter First Number:&quot;))
y = int(input (&quot;Enter Second Number:&quot;))
z = x * y
print(z)
</code></pre>
<p>This code has the same functionality, however it nests the calls to the <code>input()</code> function with the <code>int()</code> function.This could be further compacted by not assigning what int returns to variables.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">z = int(input(&quot;Enter First Number:&quot;)) * int(input(&quot;Enter Second Number:&quot;))
print(z)
</code></pre>
<p>This code has the same effect has the other two examples, except here less variables are used. These are examples of <em>style</em>. Recall that styles is subjective and whether one stylistic decisions is better than another is up to preference. However, the ulimate goal is to balance: efficiency, readability, and elegance.</p>
<h2 id="implicit-type-casting"><a class="header" href="#implicit-type-casting">Implicit Type Casting</a></h2>
<p>The casting thus far has been <em>explicit</em>. As in, we called a function that casted an object to a data type we needed.However, the interpreter often casts types itself without any intervention. This is known as <em>implicit</em> casting. For example, implicit casting occurs when doing arithmetic with object with differing types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 7.7
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x)
&lt;class 'float'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(7)
&lt;class 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = x+y
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(z)
&lt;class 'float'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here it is demonstrated that adding a float and an int results in the interpreter casting the result to a float.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="commenting"><a class="header" href="#commenting">Commenting</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-comment"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-comment">What Is A Comment?</a></h2>
<p>A comment is simply text in code that is ignored by the interpreter that gives the human reading the code more information. A comment isn't meant for the computer at all, only for humans reading the code.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-comments"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-comments">When To Use Comments</a></h2>
<p>Comments should be used to make what your code does clearer to the reader. Good uses of comments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining what a variable is for</li>
<li>Explaining what a function does</li>
<li>Dating changes</li>
<li>Leaving notes of what still needs to be done or changed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-comment"><a class="header" href="#how-to-comment">How To Comment</a></h2>
<p>In most programming languages including Python there are two types comments <em>single-line</em> and <em>multi-line</em>. </p>
<h3 id="single-line-comments"><a class="header" href="#single-line-comments">Single-Line Comments</a></h3>
<p>A single line comment is a comment where the interpreter will only ignore the line of text denoted as a comment. In Python, a single line comment is denoted by <code>#</code>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python"># This is a comment. 
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
# This is another comment
</code></pre>
<h3 id="multi-line-comments"><a class="header" href="#multi-line-comments">Multi-Line Comments</a></h3>
<p>A multi-line comment is a comment where multiple lines are denoted as being comments. Using a multi-line comments is good for larger blocks of comments like paragraphs.
Multi-line comments in Python are denoted by, <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>. Multi-line comments must be opened and closed. In other words, the first will denote the beginning of the comment, and another will denote the end.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">&quot;&quot;&quot; Everything	
between
is
as
comment.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>Before conditionals we must first learn to use <em>comparison operators</em>. Like logical operators, comparison operators return Booleans. Comparison operators compare two operands. 
One on the left and one on the right. If the comaprison is true, the operation returns true. If the comaparison is false,
the operation returns false. There are a number of comparison operators available to use in Python. The following table describes them:</p>

</div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-conditional"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-conditional">What Is a Conditional?</a></h1>
<p>A <em>conditional</em> statement is one where something is true based on, or under the condition that, something else is true.
Sometimes conditional statements are referred to as if statements.</p>
<h2 id="conditionals-in-human-language"><a class="header" href="#conditionals-in-human-language">Conditionals In Human Language</a></h2>
<p>Conditional statements exist in human language. For example: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I get a birthday gift, I will be happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this statement, I am happy <strong>IF</strong> I get a birthday gift. I am happy under the condition that I get a birthday gift. Examples
in human language can be useful in understanding the concept of a conditional. </p>
<h2 id="conditionals-in-programming"><a class="header" href="#conditionals-in-programming">Conditionals In Programming</a></h2>
<p>Conditional statements are very often used in programming. We use them so that certain code will only execute
if something is the case. So if it isn't the case, the code won't execute. Recall the boolean data type. 
Booleans are either true or false. In programming we use Booleans to represent the truthfulness of a condition.</p>
<h2 id="condition--body-structures"><a class="header" href="#condition--body-structures">Condition &amp; Body Structures</a></h2>
<p>Any structure involving conditions in Python - and most programming languages in general - follows the same basic formatting. </p>
<ol>
<li>A condition is checked</li>
<li>If the condition is true, the <em>body</em> executes. The body is the code block that will execute if condition is true.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="conditional/./imgs/conditionals.drawio.png" alt="if" /></p>
<p><em>Flow chart illustrating conditionals</em></p>
<p>Conditional structures in Python have a specific syntax like all programming languages. In Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>The line of the conditional statement is ended with a colon: <code>:</code>.</li>
<li>Every line of the body is indented</li>
</ul>
<p>Indentation is very important in Python. In Python indentation is how the body of certain structures are distinguished form other parts of the structure by the interpreter.</p>
<h2 id="if-statements"><a class="header" href="#if-statements">if statements</a></h2>
<p>If statements are one of the most basic structures of programming that we will often use. An if statement executes code based on whether a given condition is true. Here is an example of a basic if statement in Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">if (True):
    print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Using this specific example we can note things about the syntax of an if statement specific to Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>The if statement is began with the <code>if</code> keyword.</li>
<li>The condition to be checked is enclosed in parentheses</li>
<li>The line of conditional statement is ended with a colon</li>
<li>Every line of the body is indented</li>
</ul>
<p>In this specific example the the body will always execute since <code>True</code> is always true. The next example will have a more complicated condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = 10
if ( x &gt; 21 ):
	print(&quot;x is larger than 21&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the body does not execute. Try replacing x with a larger number, so that the body does execute.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="else-statements"><a class="header" href="#else-statements">Else Statements</a></h1>
<h2 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
<p>Say you've written a program that contains an <strong>if</strong> statement. But you would like the program to so something else if the <em>if</em> statement's condition is false and the <em>if</em> statement's body does not execute. This is known as <em>control flow</em>. Control flow is the control of the order of execution of code in your program. By using conditional statements of different kinds we can control what happens based on these conditions. </p>
<h2 id="else-statements-1"><a class="header" href="#else-statements-1">else statements</a></h2>
<p>The conditional statement we can use to execute code if the body of an <em>if</em> statement does not execute is an <em>else</em> statement. An else statement checks a condition following an if statement if and only if the conditional of the if statement was false and the if statement did not execute its body. </p>
<p>Say we would like to continue the example from the previous section by having the program do something else since the condition of the <em>if</em> statement is false.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = 10
if ( x &gt; 21 ):
    print(&quot;x is larger than 21&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;x is 21 or smaller&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Here an <em>else</em> statement comes directly after the <em>if</em> statement. The <em>else</em> statement's body is <code>print(&quot;x is smaller than 21&quot;)</code>, and it will execute since the body of the if statement does not. Note that an <em>else</em> statement has no conditional check. However there is technically an implicit condition: that the condition of the if statement is false. Because an <em>else</em> statement will not execute its body if the <em>if</em> statement has already executed its.</p>
<p><img src="conditional/./imgs/else.drawio.png" alt="else" />
<em>The flow from an if statement to an else statement</em></p>
<h2 id="else-if-statements"><a class="header" href="#else-if-statements">else if statements</a></h2>
<p>The <em>elif</em> statement - short for <em>else if</em> however, is an <em>else</em> statement with a condition. So it executes its body if the previous <em>if</em> statement did not execute its body <strong>AND</strong> the <em>elif</em> statement's condition is true. So, where a if-else block can be used 2 possible outcomes, an if-elif-else block can be used for 2 or more possible outcomes. Keep in mind that if the <em>if</em> statement executes its body, nothing else is done. The flow stops at the <em>if</em> statement if it has a true condition.</p>
<p><img src="conditional/./imgs/elif.drawio.png" alt="elif" /></p>
<p><em>The flow from if to elif to else statement</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = 19
if ( x &gt; 21 ):
    print(&quot;x is larger than 21&quot;)
elif (x &gt; 14):
    print(&quot;x is larger than 14&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;x is 14 or smaller&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the value of x is checked twice before the else statement finally executes. This structure could be extended using as many <em>elif</em> statements as necessary.</p>
<h1 id="nesting-1"><a class="header" href="#nesting-1">Nesting</a></h1>
<p>Just like functions, conditional statements can be <em>nested</em> as well. Recall nesting means to contain one structure within another. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = &quot;Hello&quot;
y = &quot; World!&quot;

if (x == &quot;Hello&quot;):
    if (y == &quot; World!&quot;):
        print(x+y)
</code></pre>
<p>Here the body of the next if statement executes since the inner condition and outer condition are both true. Not that this is logically the same as <strong>AND</strong>ing the conditions in a single if statement since <strong>BOTH</strong> conditions must be true.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">x = &quot;Hello&quot;
y = &quot; World!&quot;

if ( x == &quot;Hello&quot; and y == &quot; World!&quot;):
    print(x+y)
</code></pre>

<p>The other, if not the most, fundamental structure in programming are <em>loops</em>. A loop checks a condition and executes the body, then rechecks and executes the body, until the condition is false. Each time the loop executes the body is call an <em>iteration</em>. The loop will <em>iterate</em> until the condition is false.</p>
<h2 id="while-loops"><a class="header" href="#while-loops">While Loops</a></h2>
<p><em>While</em> loops are the simplest form of loops. Per the name, <em>while</em> loops iterate while their conditions are true and until they are false. Once the condition is false, the loop <em>exits</em> and moves on to the next code.
<img src="loops/./imgs/loops.drawio.png" alt="while" />
<em>The flow of a while loop</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">while(True):
	print(&quot;true&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is an infinite loop. It will iterate and print <code>&quot;true</code> forever, since the condition is never false. Not very useful. Let's try a <em>while</em> loop with a changing condition.</p>
<p>Loops are necessary for developing a process that require doing the same action multiple times. Like printing. Say I want to print every number from 0 to 1. I can do this with a while loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">n = 0
while(n &lt;= 10):
    print(n)
    n += 1
</code></pre>
<p>This script:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assigns n to the integer 0.</li>
<li>Begins a loop that will execute until n is 10.</li>
<li>Prints n.</li>
<li>Increments n by 1.</li>
<li>Repeats until n is 10.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's try another example:
Say I want to write a program that prints every multiple of 2 from 2 to 20. We can do this with a while loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">n = 2
f = 1
while(n * f &lt;= 20):
    print(n * f)
    f += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to accomplish this to to simply check if a number is even, since all multiples of 2 are by definition even. This code takes advantage of the <em>modulo</em> operator and an *if * statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">n = 1
while(n &lt;= 20):
    if ( n % 2 == 0 ):
        print(n)
    n += 1
</code></pre>
<p>This code checks every number form 1 to 20. If the number is divisible by 2 it prints, if not nothing happens and the next number is checked.</p>
<p>The next section will cover the more widely applicable and succinct looping structure, the <em>for loop</em>.</p>
