# Command Line Arguments

Many programming languages, including Python, support the use of *command line arguments*. They are also sometimes referred to as *switches*.  A command line argument is essentially a way of configuring and applying settings when a program or script is ran at the command line. 

Refer to the first chapter's section *Command Line Interface or CLI* for more information.

In Python, command line arguments are best implemented through the module *argparse* availabe in the standard library. This module helps with:

* Defining Arguments
* Storing Arguments
* Designating default values
* Desginating required arguments
* Designing help messages

For examples that utilize command line arguments, check the examples and projects sections.
